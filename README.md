# World-Weather-Analysis

World weather data analysis using

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas Library
- CityPy Module
- Python Requests
- APIs
- JSON Traversals

to collect weather data from over 500 cities around the world.
 
## Weather Database

In Weather Database, we generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap and retrieve the current weather description of each town.

## Vacation Search

In Vacation Search, we use Input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Using Google Maps API, we show those destinations on a map with a pop-up description of the location.

## Vacation Itinerary

In Vacation Itinerary, we use the Google Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s travel destinations. Finally, we construct a map with a pop-up location and weather information for each city on the itinerary.
